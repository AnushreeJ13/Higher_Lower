                        The Financial Industry has entered the Artificial Intelligence (AI) phase
                        of the digital marathon, a journey that started with the advent of the
                        internet and has taken organizations through several stages of digitalisation.
                        The emergence of AI is disrupting the physics of the industry, weakening the
                        bonds that have held together the components of the traditional financial
                        institutions and opening the door to more innovations and new operating models.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Artificial intelligence (AI) in finance helps drive insights for data analytics,
                        performance measurement, predictions and forecasting, real-time calculations,
                        customer servicing, intelligent data retrieval, and more. It is a set of
                        technologies that enables financial services organizations to better understand
                        markets and customers, analyze and learn from digital journeys, and engage in a
                        way that mimics human intelligence and interactions at scale.
                        <br/><br/>
                        AI in finance can help in five general areas: personalize services
                        and products, create opportunities, manage risk and fraud, enable
                        transparency and compliance, and automate operations and reduce costs.
                        With AI as part of their infrastructure, banks, investment firms, and
                        insurance companies can use it to perform real-time calculations to forecast
                        performance, detect anomalous spending behavior, and many other applications.
                        In recent years, technological advances and competitive pressures have fuelled
                        rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in the financial sector, and
                        this adoption is set to accelerate with the recent emergence of generative
                        AI (GenAI). GenAI is a significant leap forward in AI technology that enhances
                        its utility for financial institutions that have been quick at adapting it to
                        a broad range of applications.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Some benefits of AI in finance are:
                        <br/><br/>
                        <b>Productivity</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Faster analysis/insights</li>
                            <li>Reduced time to produce narrative/statutory reports</li>
                            <li>Reduced time to generate and audit financial statements</li>
                            <li>Reduced time to complete monthly financial close</li>  
                        </ul>
                        <br/>
                        <b>Accuracy</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reduced errors in automated tasks</li>
                            <li>Improved forecast, planning, and modeling accuracy (e.g., sales forecast)</li>
                            <li>Reduced risk/security events</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br/>
                        <b>Business Value</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Improved understanding of why the business is performing at the level it is</li>
                            <li>Improved profitability by identifying more/less profitable areas of the organization</li>
                            <li>Improved workforce planning (e.g., assessing talent gaps, predicting salary costs, etc.)</li> 
                        </ul>
                        <br/>
                        According to Forbes, 54% of financial service organizations
                        with 5,000+ employees are using artificial intelligence. Here
                        are some examples:
                        <br/><br/>
                        <ul>
                            <li> <b>JPMorgan Chase:</b> The bank uses key fraud detecting applications, including implementing an algorithm to detect fraud patterns, according to Business Insider. Details of credit card transactions are sent to data centers, which decide whether the transactions are fraudulent.</li>
                            <li> <b>Kensho:</b> According to the company's website, Kensho builds analytical products used by some of the world's leading financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan Chase.</li>
                            <li> <b>Alphasense:</b> An AI-powered search engine that uses natural language processing to analyze keyword searches and discover trends and changes in the markets.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br/>
                        However, this influx of AI in finance also brings forth new challenges related to data security and transparency. As data management practices evolve with the introduction of new AI solutions, it is essential for organizations to be aware of the expected challenges and build safeguards to maintain forward momentum.
                        <br/><br/>
                        AI plays a key role in helping drive tailored customer responses, make safer and more accountable product and service recommendations, and earn trust by broadening concierge services that are available when customers need them the most. Financial organizations also face many security and compliance regulations because of the sensitive and personal information they use every day. Any AI solution must be capable of protecting that data and abide by industry- and region-specific guidelines, since finance is a global concern and covers a large swath of companies.</p>
